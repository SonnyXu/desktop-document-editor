# google-doc

What are we building?

A collaborative rich-text editing desktop application. Users will be able to create, view, edit, and share their documents from a Desktop App.

Why are we building this? 

Quickly accessing and editing important documents is very important for highly collaborative teams. As users start to need more and more browser tabs, even powerful computers quickly slow down. There is a real opportunity to reduce the clicks and time needed to access, edit and share documents when compared to today’s web-based alternatives (ie Google Docs). 

iNotes, Evernote, and other Desktop based note-taking apps lack the real-time / collaborative nature of something like Google Docs. 

What are the key features?

We will be implementing the following features: 
Users’ documents support rich-text formatting (bold text, italics, alignment, etc.).
Users use document-specific URLs to access and modify their documents. 
Users can send these document-specific URLs to people they would like to collaborate on documents with. 
When multiple users are editing the same document, other users can see what edits are being made by which users in real-time. 
All documents are persistent in a database. 

Technologies used: React, Draftjs, MongoDB, Websockets.
